    "To get information about remotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git remote\n",
    "# Shows the name 'origin' (default name for a remote)\n",
    "\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "# Shows detailed information about URLs:\n",
    "# origin    /Users/imiell/gitcourse/git_origin (fetch)\n",
    "# origin    /Users/imiell/gitcourse/git_origin (push)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The name 'origin' is the default name for a remote, but it has no special meaning. It could be renamed to 'bitbucket', 'gitlab', etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git Fetch\n",
    "\n",
    "`git fetch` gets the latest changes from the remote repository and copies them into the local repository. **Crucially, these changes are kept in a separate place.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# First, make a change to the origin's repo:\n",
    "cd git_origin\n",
    "echo 'fetchable change' >> file1\n",
    "git commit -am fetchable\n",
    "\n",
    "# Then go to the cloned repository and fetch the changes:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Check what branches are available:\n",
    "git branch --all\n",
    "# Shows:\n",
    "# * master\n",
    "#   remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master\n",
    "#   remotes/origin/master\n",
    "\n",
    "# To apply the remote master's changes to the local one:\n",
    "git merge origin/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git Pull vs Fetch + Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** A fetch followed by a merge is what `git pull` does in one go. A pull fetches the mapped branch and then merges it into the local branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull origin master\n",
    "# Is equivalent to:\n",
    "git fetch origin master\n",
    "git merge origin/master\n",
    "```"

    "# Working with Multiple Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This section covers how to work with multiple repositories in a distributed team environment, demonstrating the \"Lieutenants\" model that Git was originally designed for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Multiple Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create the same setup as before, but with multiple cloned repositories:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir git_origin\n",
    "cd git_origin\n",
    "git init\n",
    "echo 'first commit' > file1\n",
    "git add file1\n",
    "git commit -am file1\n",
    "cd ..\n",
    "\n",
    "git clone git_origin alice_cloned\n",
    "git clone git_origin bob_cloned\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now `alice_cloned` and `bob_cloned` both have `git_origin` as their origin:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd alice_cloned\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "# origin    /Users/imiell/gitcourse/git_origin (fetch)\n",
    "# origin    /Users/imiell/gitcourse/git_origin (push)\n",
    "\n",
    "cd ../bob_cloned\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "# origin    /Users/imiell/gitcourse/git_origin (fetch)\n",
    "# origin    /Users/imiell/gitcourse/git_origin (push)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Distributed Workflow Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Alice makes a change in her master branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd alice_cloned\n",
    "echo alice_change >> file1\n",
    "git commit -am 'alice change'\n",
    "# [master 9077a48] alice change\n",
    "#  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: How does Bob get Alice's change into his master branch without going through the central origin?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common scenario in distributed teams. If you consider that Git was created for managing the Linux kernel codebase, it's easy to imagine:\n",
    "- `git_origin` as Linus Torvalds' repository\n",
    "- `alice_cloned` as a contributor's repository  \n",
    "- `bob_cloned` as a lieutenant's repository\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Direct Repository-to-Repository Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves three steps:\n",
    "1. **ADD** Alice's repository as a remote to Bob's\n",
    "2. **FETCH** Alice's updated master branch\n",
    "3. **MERGE** Alice's master branch into Bob's local one\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 2 and 3 can be collapsed into `git pull`, but keeping them separate is more instructive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: ADD Alice's Repository as a Remote\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Bob needs to add Alice's repository as a remote:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd bob_cloned\n",
    "git remote add alice ../alice_cloned\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "# alice    ../alice_cloned/ (fetch)\n",
    "# alice    ../alice_cloned/ (push)\n",
    "# origin   /Users/imiell/gitcourse/git_origin (fetch)\n",
    "# origin   /Users/imiell/gitcourse/git_origin (push)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now linked Bob's repository to Alice's, giving it the name 'alice'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: FETCH Alice's Updated Master Branch\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git fetch alice master\n",
    "# remote: Counting objects: 3, done.\n",
    "# remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\n",
    "# Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.\n",
    "# From ../alice_cloned\n",
    "#  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD\n",
    "#  * [new branch]      master     -> alice/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice's master branch is now fetched to Bob's local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git branch -vv -a\n",
    "# * master                fdc7132 [origin/master] file1\n",
    "#   remotes/alice/master  9077a48 alice change\n",
    "#   remotes/origin/HEAD   -> origin/master\n",
    "#   remotes/origin/master fdc7132 file1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: MERGE Alice's Master Branch into Bob's Local One\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge alice/master\n",
    "# Updating fdc7132..9077a48\n",
    "# Fast-forward\n",
    "#  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n",
    "\n",
    "cat file1\n",
    "# first commit\n",
    "# alice_change\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note About Remote Branch References\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why we use `alice/master` and not `remotes/alice/master`, as the output of `git branch -vv -a` shows. You can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge remotes/alice/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will do the same thing. Git assumes that the branch is a remote (presumably from seeing the '/' in the branch name) and adds the 'remotes/' prefix for you automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Lieutenants Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"Lieutenants\" model is one example of a Git workflow. Although it was the one Git was originally created for, it is still common for developers to use a traditional centralized model around a repository such as GitLab or BitBucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why people make jokes when GitHub is down about the fact that it should not be a problem because Git is a distributed source control tool - you can work directly between repositories without a central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Repository Communication**: Repositories can communicate directly without going through a central server\n",
    "2. **Multiple Remotes**: A single repository can have multiple remotes pointing to different repositories\n",
    "3. **Distributed Workflow**: Changes can flow between any repositories, not just through a central hub\n",
    "4. **Flexible Collaboration**: Team members can share changes directly or through intermediaries\n",
    "5. **Git's Distributed Nature**: The system works even when central servers are unavailable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source Development**: Contributors can share work directly with maintainers\n",
    "- **Team Collaboration**: Developers can share work-in-progress with specific team members\n",
    "- **Code Review**: Changes can be shared directly for review before going to the main repository\n",
    "- **Backup and Redundancy**: Multiple repositories provide redundancy and backup options"
